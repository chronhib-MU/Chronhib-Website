# Chronhib Website - Database Guide/FAQs

CorPH is an on-line database of Old Irish texts curated by the ChronHib project. It incorporates and harmonises several pre-existing digital databases of Old Irish texts, as well as digitalises and annotates a number of other Old Irish texts. All data have undergone digitalisation, tokenisation, lemmatisation, POS- and morphological tagging, following the rules and tagsets created by ChronHib, which can be downloaded from this webpage.

Pre-existing digital databases that have been incorporated into CorPH include the following. ChronHib has acquired their respective authors’ authorisation to copy, modify, display and distribute the Work as part of the database ‘Corpus Palaeo-Hibernicum’, or CorPH:
